# Types of domains

Punk Domains is a **modular** domain protocol, which means it can support different types of domains with different features and business models.

Currently supported domain types are the following:

- **Standard domains:**
  - One-time purchase domains
  - Limited set of features
- **Flexi domains:**
  - One-time purchase domains
  - Many additional features such as custom domain images and metadata, minter role, etc.
- **Soulbound domains:**
  - One-time purchase domains
  - The same features as Flexi domains
  - Non-transferrable domains
- **Renewable domains:**
  - Domains with an expiration date
  - Need to be periodically renewed
  - (Still under development)
