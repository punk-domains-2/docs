# About Punk Domains

Punk Domains allows you to register a domain name attached to your account address.

### Why would anyone need that?

Well, your crypto address is hard to remember. It starts with `0x`, but then continues with 40 random characters (digits from `0` to `9` and letters from `a` to `f`).

If you want someone to send you tokens, sure you could send them your address and they could copy-paste it into their wallet. But wouldn't it be great if they could just enter a domain name, like `techie.wagmi`, instead of the whole address?

This is what they can do on punk.domains (on the Send Tokens page).

Another usecase is to have a domain name as your username in various web3 dApps, games and upcoming social networks. Instead of your username being `0xb29â€¦45D`, it could be simply `techie.wagmi`.

An additional feature that Punk Domains provide is a browser extension that takes you to a designated URL address if you type a domain name into browser URL bar.

### But isn't all that what ENS is doing already?

Yes, but they only do it on Ethereum L1 and (for now) only with `.eth`. Punk Domains allows many different top-level domains (TLDs), such as `.wagmi`, `.gnosis`, `.ape`, `.op` etc. And it runs on multiple chains.

Punk Domains enables anyone to create a TLD, operate it and earn revenue from it. For example, a DeFi protocol like Agave could create a TLD named `.agave`, and the revenue from each domain purchase would go to Agave treasury.

Punk Domains architecture is very flexible and it allows for various domain business models. The first one is a one-time domain purchase (no renewals), but new ones will be added in the future (like time-restricted domain ownership).

### Not just about domains

Punk Domains is not just about domains (in the web2 sense of the word). It's about **identity** in the web3 world. Domain name gives you a digital identity, and data attached to this identity strengthen it.

Another thing that Punk Domains cherishes is full decentralization. The contracts are non-upgradable and don't need any keepers (or similar outside software) to properly operate. The only thing not decentralized yet is the main factory contract ownership (the one that decides a new TLD price) - but stay tuned... ðŸ˜‰
