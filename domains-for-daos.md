# Domains for DAOs

On Punk Domains, every top-level domain (like .web3, .spartan, .wagmi) can be owned by a different entity. Which makes it perfect for DAOs.

### 1. Unity and belonging

Let's say there's a DAO called *BestDAO* with very active and excited community members. BestDAO can create a TLD on Punk Domains called `.bestdao`.

This provides the community members with a **stronger sense of unity**. Members can mint domain names (or usernames) such as `tina.bestdao`, `mack.bestdao`, `raoul.bestdao`, etc. which increases their feeling of belonging to the common cause.

### 2. Income for DAO treasury

It also gives the DAO treasury a **new source of income**. Revenue from minting domains goes **directly** to the DAO treasury.

As the TLD owner, DAO can also mint domains **for free**, which is very useful for **rewards** in community **competitions**.

### 3. Spreading awareness about your DAO

And last, but not least, it's a great **marketing** vehicle outside the community channels. 

Members can use domain names as **usernames** on platforms like **Twitter** and this way **increase the awareness** about their DAO - similar to how `.eth` helped increase awareness about Ethereum outside the crypto space.
