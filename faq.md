# FAQ

### 1. What is a Top Level Domain (TLD)?

A top-level domain is what some people call a domain *extension*. In the traditional world the most common TLDs are:

- `.com`
- `.org`
- `.net`
- and country TLDs like `.de`, `.es`, `.co.uk`, etc.

In the blockchain world we have our own TLDs, the most well-known is `.eth` by ENS.

Punk Domains has introduced many new TLDs to the web3 world, some of them are:

- `.web3`
- `.gnosis`
- `.wagmi`
- `.ape`
- `.xdai`
- ... and many more.

### 2. What is a domain name?

Domain name is the "middle" part of a domain (between the top-level domain and the subdomain parts).

For example, if you have a domain called `techie.web3`, the domain name is `techie` (and `.web3` is a top-level domain or TLD).

### 3. How can I use a domain? Will it replace my public wallet address? 

The main purpose for blockchain domains is to be a "shortcut" for your address.

Crypto addresses are hard to remember. Ethereum-style addresses start with `0x`, and continue with 40 random characters (digits from `0` to `9` and letters from `a` to `f`).

Having a domain name provides an easy to remember shortcut for your address. If wallet supports domains, then you can enter a domain as a token receiver, and wallet will check (in the background) which address this domain is connected with.

Blockchain domains can also have other use cases. They can be **usernames** in crypto games and web3 social networks or chat apps. They can also hold many other (optional) data like a profile picture (PFP), subdomains, other addresses, email addresses etc. ([more info on custom data here](/contracts/custom-data.md)).
